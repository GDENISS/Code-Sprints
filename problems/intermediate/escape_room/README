🔍 Problem Statement: Digital Lock Puzzle System
Scenario:

You are developing the logic for a security system in an escape room. The room features a digital lock that requires a special 3-digit number to unlock. The twist: the number must be a Disarium number—a number where the sum of its digits raised to the power of their respective positions equals the number itself.

For example, 135 is a Disarium number because:
1¹ + 3² + 5³ = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135

To add to the challenge, players find a keypad and a hint:

"The number unlocks only when it respects the power of its own parts."

Your task is to validate the number entered by the players and determine whether it’s a Disarium number, unlocking the door if it is.

📥 Input:
An integer n, the number entered into the digital keypad.

📤 Output:
A boolean: true if the number is a Disarium number, false otherwise.
